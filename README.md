**[Release] [YMAP] Legion Square Upgrade.**

---

The Legion Square Upgrade is an upgrade of the Legion Square area which adds about 25+ new props to the area. It was hand built in Codewalker, with each prop being hand placed and moved into position. This YMAP is aesthetically pleasing with no errors. You can see the props from far away, and this upgrade is how Rockstar Games should of made Legion Square.
